# Virtual_queues
A web site that would create virtual queues instead of waiting in line for services provided by a company.
Connecting to a queue is as easy as making an account and finding a service of owns choosing, alternatively 
you can connect via QR kod by providing your QR to a QR scanner that has been programmed for that perticular service.
