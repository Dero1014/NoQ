# Virtual_queues
A website that would create virtual queues instead of waiting in line for services provided by a company. 
Connecting to a queue is as easy as making an account and finding a service of own choosing, alternatively 
you can connect via QR code by providing your QR to a QR scanner that has been programmed for that particular service.
